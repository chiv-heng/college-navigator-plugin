# Report Templates

Three report documents: a shareable counselor report, a private supplement for
the student, and a self-guide for students without counselor access.

## Privacy Model

By default, reports split into **shareable** and **private** documents:

| Document | Default Audience | Contains |
|----------|-----------------|----------|
| **Counselor Report** | Shareable with counselor | Academics, interests, college preferences, college list, discussion topics, resource assessment |
| **Private Supplement** | Student only | Personal context, financial context, financial action items |
| **Student Self-Guide** | Student only (alternative to counselor report) | All sections — no privacy split needed |

**Before generating, ask the student** whether they want to share any private
sections with their counselor. If they opt in, move those sections into the
counselor report and note them as "Included at student's request."

## Sharing This Information

Some students find it helpful to share financial context with their
guidance counselor — especially if the counselor is helping build
a college list. A counselor who understands the financial picture can
recommend schools with strong aid programs and help identify
scholarship opportunities.

**To share with your counselor:** Let the interviewer know, and these
sections will be added to your counselor report, clearly marked as
information you chose to share.

**To keep private:** This document stays with you. Use it for your
own planning and financial aid applications.

## Report Generation Notes

### Tone Differences

| Counselor Report | Private Supplement | Student Self-Guide |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Professional, structured | Factual, planning-oriented | Warm, direct, encouraging |
| Third person ("The student...") | Second person, practical | Second person, affirming |
| Analytical framing | Action-oriented | Action-oriented |
| Flags gaps for counselor | Flags financial actions | Provides solutions and resources |
| Assumes counseling knowledge | Assumes student audience | Explains concepts as needed |

### Vocabulary and Jargon

All reports — regardless of type — must spell out abbreviations and define
admissions terminology on first use. Write "biomedical engineering (BME)" before
using "BME" alone. Define terms like "open curriculum," "demonstrated interest,"
"need-blind admissions," "3-2 dual-degree program," "test-optional," "holistic
review," and any field-specific language. The student self-guide should be
especially careful about this, but even the counselor report benefits from
clarity (some counselors are overloaded and may not be deep in every school's
specific terminology).

### Completeness Requirements

**Minimum for Counselor Report:** Academic Profile + one other shareable section
substantially complete. Missing sections noted as "Not yet assessed."

**Minimum for Private Supplement:** Financial Context or Personal Context
substantially complete. Only generate if there is private information to include.

**Minimum for Student Self-Guide:** Academic Profile + Support Assessment. The
guide needs enough information to provide actionable advice.

### Customization Based on Support Level

**Level 1-2 students:** Shorter self-guide, more focused on preferences and fit.
They have support for the process stuff. Private supplement focuses on financial
planning actions.

**Level 3-4 students:** Longer self-guide with more process education, timeline
detail, and resource links. The guide needs to function as a standalone roadmap.
Private supplement includes more detailed financial aid walkthrough.

### File Naming Convention

All reports for one student share a prefix:
- `{student-name}-counselor-report.md` — shareable with counselor
- `{student-name}-private-supplement.md` — student-only
- `{student-name}-self-guide.md` — alternative to counselor report (for Level 3-4)
- `{student-name}-gap-analysis.md` — from the profile-gap-reviewer agent

PDF versions use the same names with `.pdf` extension.
