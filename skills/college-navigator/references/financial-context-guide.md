# Financial Context Guide

Assessing a student's financial context is essential for realistic college planning
but requires sensitivity. This guide provides the approach, key concepts to assess
understanding of, and frameworks for different financial situations.

## Approach Principles

1. **Normalize the conversation.** "Every family has a different financial picture,
   and that's totally normal. Understanding yours helps identify the best options."
2. **Let the student lead.** Offer the opportunity to discuss finances; don't force it.
   "We can talk about the financial side if you're comfortable — it's helpful but
   not required right now."
3. **No assumptions.** Don't assume financial status from school, neighborhood, race,
   or any other proxy. Ask directly but gently.
4. **Educate as you go.** Many students (and families) don't understand financial aid.
   Brief explanations during the conversation are more useful than a separate lecture.
5. **Frame around planning, not judgment.** The goal is to identify what the student
   needs to do and what options exist, not to categorize their family's wealth.

## Key Financial Aid Concepts

Assess whether the student understands these. Explain briefly if they don't.

### FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid)
- Required for almost all financial aid (federal, state, and most institutional)
- Opens October 1 each year; deadlines vary by state and school
- Based on family income and assets
- Determines Expected Family Contribution (now called Student Aid Index / SAI)
- **Key question:** "Have you or your family heard of the FAFSA?"

### CSS Profile
- Required by ~200 mostly private colleges for institutional aid
- More detailed than FAFSA (includes home equity, non-custodial parent info)
- Has a fee ($25 + $16 per school) but fee waivers are available
- **Key question:** "Are any of the schools you're considering private colleges?"
  (If yes, may need CSS Profile)

### Types of Financial Aid
- **Grants/Scholarships:** Free money, don't repay. Need-based or merit-based.
- **Work-study:** Part-time job on campus, earned income.
- **Loans:** Must be repaid. Federal loans have better terms than private.
- **Key question:** "Do you know the difference between grants and loans?"

### Net Price vs Sticker Price
- Sticker price (published cost) can be $80,000+/year at private schools
- Net price (what the family actually pays) is often much lower
- Net Price Calculators on every school's website give estimates
- **Key question:** "Has anyone explained that the published price isn't usually
  what families pay?"

### Need-Based vs Merit-Based Aid
- **Need-based:** Based on family financial situation (FAFSA/CSS Profile)
- **Merit-based:** Based on student achievement (grades, scores, talents)
- Many schools offer both; some (e.g., Ivy League) offer only need-based
- **Key question:** "Are you hoping for financial aid based on need, merit, or both?"

## Financial Profile Categories

Use these internally to calibrate the report and recommendations. Do NOT label
the student with these categories — they're analytical tools.

### Category A: Full-Pay Capable
**Signals:** Family has discussed budget openly, mentions savings/529, no financial
stress indicated, may mention specific price ranges they're comfortable with.

**Profile notes:** Document budget range if shared. Note whether merit aid is
still desired (it often is). Ensure the student isn't limiting options unnecessarily.

### Category B: Aid-Dependent, Moderate Need
**Signals:** Family has some resources but needs aid to make college work. May
mention needing scholarships, concern about debt, or preference for in-state options.

**Profile notes:** FAFSA completion is critical. Recommend net price calculators.
Mix of schools with strong merit aid and schools that meet full demonstrated need.
Flag schools known for "gapping" (not meeting full need).

### Category C: Significant Need
**Signals:** Mentions free/reduced lunch eligibility, single-parent household with
limited income, family has not saved for college, significant financial stress.

**Profile notes:** Likely Pell Grant eligible. FAFSA is essential and urgent.
Prioritize schools that meet 100% of demonstrated need without loans.
Flag: fee waivers (application fees, test registration, CSS Profile).
Flag: QuestBridge and similar programs for high-achieving, low-income students.
Community college + transfer is a legitimate and strategic path — present
without stigma.

### Category D: Financial Situation Unclear
**Signals:** Student doesn't know, parents haven't discussed it, student is
uncomfortable sharing.

**Profile notes:** Note the gap. Recommend the student have a conversation with
parents/guardians specifically about college costs. Provide the "Family Financial
Conversation Starter" talking points (below). Flag that FAFSA should be completed
regardless.

## Family Financial Conversation Starter

If the student doesn't know their financial situation, suggest they ask their
parents/guardians these questions:

1. Have you thought about how we'll pay for college?
2. Is there money saved for college? (529, savings, other)
3. What's a realistic budget per year for college costs?
4. Would you be willing to fill out the FAFSA together?
5. Are there other financial obligations I should know about? (Siblings in college,
   family business, medical expenses, etc.)

## Free Resources to Note in Report

- **FAFSA:** studentaid.gov (free to file)
- **Net Price Calculators:** Available on every college website
- **Khan Academy SAT Prep:** Free, official practice (khanacademy.org)
- **Fee Waivers:** Common App, Coalition App, SAT, ACT all offer fee waivers
  for qualifying students
- **QuestBridge:** questbridge.org (matches high-achieving, low-income students)
- **College Greenlight:** scholarships for underrepresented students
- **State-specific programs:** Many states have guaranteed admission or
  scholarship programs (e.g., Georgia HOPE, Florida Bright Futures, Texas Top 10%)

## Red Flags to Surface in Report

These situations require explicit attention in the counselor report:

- Student has no FAFSA awareness and no one guiding them through it
- Family expects to pay sticker price (may be leaving aid money on the table)
- Student is avoiding applying to schools they want due to cost assumptions
  (sticker shock without understanding net price)
- Student is considering significant private loan debt without understanding terms
- First-gen student with no financial guidance from school or family
- Student is working excessive hours to support family, affecting academics
