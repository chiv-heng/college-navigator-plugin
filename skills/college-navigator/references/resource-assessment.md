# Resource Assessment Framework

This reference provides a structured framework for evaluating the resources and
support a student has access to for the college search and admissions process.
The assessment informs what level of guidance the report should provide.

## Why This Matters

The college admissions process is complex and opaque. Students with access to
knowledgeable counselors, college-educated parents, and information networks
navigate it with built-in advantages. Students without these resources often
don't know what they don't know. This assessment identifies the student's
starting point so the profile and report can meet them there.

## Assessment Dimensions

### 1. School-Based Support

**Strong indicators:**
- Dedicated college counselor (not general guidance counselor handling discipline, scheduling, AND college)
- Counselor-to-student ratio under 250:1
- School offers college planning curriculum or workshops
- School uses Naviance, Scoir, or similar college planning platform
- School hosts college fairs, campus visits from admissions reps
- Teachers write detailed, personalized recommendation letters

**Weak indicators:**
- No dedicated college counselor, or counselor responsible for 400+ students
- No college planning resources or curriculum
- Limited or no college fair / admissions rep visits
- Students expected to figure out applications independently
- No school-provided access to college search tools

**Questions to assess:**
- "How often do you meet with your counselor about college?"
- "Does your school have a college planning class or workshops?"
- "Have college admissions representatives visited your school?"

### 2. Family & Social Network

**Strong indicators:**
- One or both parents have college degrees
- Older siblings have been through the process recently
- Extended family or family friends in higher education
- Family actively involved in college planning
- Family can pay for campus visits, test prep, application fees

**Weak indicators:**
- First-generation college student (neither parent has a bachelor's degree)
- No family members with recent college admissions experience
- Family supportive but unable to provide guidance on the process
- Family unaware of timelines, requirements, or financial aid
- Geographic or economic barriers to campus visits

**Questions to assess:**
- "Did your parents go to college?"
- "Has anyone in your family helped you with college planning?"
- "Do you have friends or family members who've gone through this recently?"

### 3. Information Access & Literacy

**Strong indicators:**
- Student can name specific schools and articulate why they're interested
- Student understands application components (essays, recommendations, transcripts)
- Student is aware of early decision/early action options
- Student has used college search tools (Common App, BigFuture, Niche)
- Student understands the concept of "reach, match, safety" school categories

**Weak indicators:**
- Student unsure what the application involves
- Student doesn't know about early decision/action
- Student has only heard of a handful of (usually famous) schools
- Student unaware of application deadlines or timelines
- Student doesn't know what standardized tests are required or optional

**Questions to assess:**
- "What do you know about the college application process?"
- "Where do you get your information about colleges?"
- "Have you heard of the Common App?"
- "Do you know when college applications are due?"

### 4. Community Resources

**Strong indicators:**
- Access to community-based college prep organizations (e.g., Posse Foundation,
  KIPP, Upward Bound, Prep for Prep, A Better Chance)
- Participation in pre-college summer programs
- Access to private college counselor or tutor
- Church, mosque, temple, or community center with college guidance
- Local scholarship programs

**Weak indicators:**
- No community-based college support programs available
- No awareness of external support organizations
- Rural or isolated community with limited access
- No local scholarship ecosystem
- No mentorship relationships with college-educated adults

**Questions to assess:**
- "Are there any organizations in your community that help with college planning?"
- "Have you participated in any pre-college or summer programs?"
- "Is there anyone outside your school and family who's helped with college stuff?"

## Support Level Classification

Based on the assessment, classify the student's overall support level. This
determines the depth and tone of the report.

### Level 1: Well-Supported
Active counselor + college-educated family + strong information literacy.
**Report approach:** Complement existing support. Identify blind spots. Focus on
preferences and fit rather than process education.

### Level 2: Partially Supported
Has some resources but significant gaps. Common pattern: involved family but no
counselor, OR good counselor but first-gen family.
**Report approach:** Fill specific gaps. Provide targeted resources for the weak
areas. Bridge between what they know and what they need.

### Level 3: Under-Supported
Limited school support + first-gen + low information literacy.
**Report approach:** Comprehensive guidance. Explain the process alongside the
profile. Include timelines, checklists, and specific free resources. The report
serves as a mini college planning guide, not just a profile summary.

### Level 4: Self-Navigating
Student is largely on their own. May have supportive family but no one with
college knowledge. No counselor engagement.
**Report approach:** Maximum detail. The report IS their counselor. Include:
step-by-step timeline, application checklist, financial aid walkthrough, and
specific school suggestions based on their profile. Connect them to free
support programs if eligible.

## Resource Gaps to Flag

Always surface these in the report if identified:

| Gap | Why It Matters | Suggested Action |
|-----|---------------|-----------------|
| No FAFSA guidance | Leaves federal aid on the table | Direct to studentaid.gov, school counselor |
| No test prep access | Disadvantaged on standardized tests | Khan Academy (free), school-provided prep |
| No campus visit opportunity | Can't assess fit firsthand | Virtual tours, fly-in programs (free) |
| No recommendation letter writers | Weak application component | Build teacher relationships now |
| No application fee budget | Limits number of applications | Fee waivers (Common App, Coalition) |
| No essay support | Personal statement is critical | Free essay review services, school English teacher |
| Unaware of application timelines | Risks missing deadlines | Provide month-by-month timeline |
| No understanding of financial aid | May not apply, or over-borrow | Basic financial aid education in report |

## First-Generation Student Considerations

First-gen status deserves special attention:

- **It's an asset in admissions.** Many colleges actively seek first-gen students.
  Make sure the student knows this.
- **Dedicated support programs exist.** QuestBridge, Posse, Matriculate, College
  Advising Corps, and many school-specific programs.
- **Hidden curriculum is real.** Things that seem obvious to families with college
  experience (visiting campus, understanding financial aid packages, negotiating
  merit aid, choosing classes strategically) need to be explicitly taught.
- **The emotional dimension matters.** First-gen students may feel imposter syndrome,
  family guilt about leaving, or pressure to stay close to home. Acknowledge
  these feelings if they surface.
- **Post-enrollment support matters too.** Suggest looking at schools with strong
  first-gen support offices, mentoring programs, and bridge programs.
