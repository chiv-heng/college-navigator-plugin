# Interview Guide — Detailed Question Trees

This reference provides the detailed question flows for each profile section.
Questions are organized as primary questions (always ask) and follow-up questions
(ask based on the student's responses).

## General Interview Techniques

- Ask one or two questions at a time, never a list
- Acknowledge what the student shares before asking the next question
- Use the student's own language when reflecting back
- If a student seems uncomfortable, offer to skip and come back later
- Watch for cues that suggest depth or surface-level understanding

## Section 1: Academic Profile

### Primary Questions

**Current standing:**
- What grade are you in? What school do you attend?
- What's your current GPA? (Weighted or unweighted — note which they report)
- Have you taken the SAT or ACT? What were your scores?
  - If not taken: Are you planning to? When?

**Course rigor:**
- Are you taking any AP, IB, or honors courses? Which ones?
- What's the most challenging class you've taken in high school?
- Are there courses you wish your school offered but doesn't?

**Academic strengths and challenges:**
- What subjects do you feel strongest in?
- What subjects are hardest for you?
- How would your teachers describe you as a student?

### Adaptive Follow-ups

**If GPA is strong (3.5+):**
- Has your GPA been consistent, or was there a trend (improving/declining)?
- What's your class rank, if your school does ranking?
- Are you in any academic honors programs?

**If GPA is moderate (2.5-3.4):**
- Has your GPA changed over time? Was there a year that was particularly tough?
- Are there circumstances that affected your grades that you'd want colleges to know about?
- What does your GPA not show about you as a student?

**If GPA is low (<2.5) or student doesn't know:**
- That's completely fine — GPA is just one number. What are you good at in school?
- Are there things outside school that have been a priority?
- Is improving your grades something you're working on?

**If test scores are available:**
- How do you feel about your scores? Do they reflect your ability?
- Are you planning to retake?
- Some schools are test-optional — is that something you're considering?

**If test scores are not available:**
- Are you planning to take the SAT or ACT?
- Do you have access to test prep resources? (Free: Khan Academy, school-provided)
- Are you interested in test-optional schools?

## Section 2: Interests & Identity

### Primary Questions

**Academic interests:**
- If you could study anything in college, what would it be?
  - If unsure: What topics make you lose track of time? What do you watch/read about for fun?

- Have you done anything outside school related to [field]? (Research, internships, projects)
- Do you know what kind of program you're looking for? (Research university, liberal arts, specialized)

**If the student is undecided:**
- That's very normal — most students change their major at least once. What are you curious about?
- Do you prefer breadth (trying many things) or depth (going deep on one thing)?
- A liberal arts college lets you explore before committing — does that appeal to you?

**If the student has significant extracurricular commitment:**

- Note: work experience demonstrates maturity and responsibility — important context for the profile

## Section 3: Financial Context

**See `financial-context-guide.md` for detailed approach to these sensitive questions.**

### Primary Questions (approached carefully)

**Framing:** "Understanding your family's financial situation helps identify which
schools are realistic options and what financial aid to pursue. You can share as
much or as little as you're comfortable with."

- Have your parents/guardians talked with you about a college budget?
  - If yes: What's the general picture? (Can cover full cost, need significant aid, somewhere in between)
  - If no: That's common. Let me explain the basics of how college costs work. [Brief overview]

- Do you know if your family has saved for college? (529 plan, savings account)
- Are there siblings who are also heading to or in college?
- Is paying for college something that causes stress in your family?

### Adaptive Follow-ups

**If family has discussed finances:**
- Do you know your family's approximate income range? (This determines aid eligibility)
- Has anyone mentioned the FAFSA or CSS Profile?
- Are there specific price points that have been discussed?

**If family has NOT discussed finances:**
- Has anyone in your family filled out the FAFSA before?
- Do you know if your family would qualify for free/reduced lunch? (Proxy for Pell Grant eligibility)
- Would it be helpful to understand the basics of college financial aid?

**If financial stress is indicated:**
- Note: Many students from all income levels attend college with financial aid.
  Some schools meet 100% of demonstrated need.
- Are you aware of fee waivers for applications and test registration?
- Has anyone mentioned scholarship opportunities?

## Section 4: Support & Resources Assessment

### Primary Questions

**Guidance counselor relationship:**
- Do you have a guidance counselor at school? How often do you meet with them?
- Have they talked to you about college planning?
- How many students does your counselor work with? (The student may not know — that's okay)
- On a scale of 1-5, how helpful has your counselor been with college planning?

**Family experience:**
- Did your parents/guardians go to college?
  - If yes: Where? Do they have opinions about where you should go?
  - If no: That makes you a potential first-generation college student — that's actually something many colleges value and support
- Do you have older siblings or close family members who've been through the college process recently?
- Is anyone in your family helping you with college planning?

**Information access:**
- Where do you get information about colleges? (Internet, school, family, friends, counselor)
- Have you visited any colleges? Attended any college fairs?
- Have you used any college search tools? (Common App, Naviance, BigFuture, Niche)
- Do you feel like you know what the college application process involves?

### Adaptive Follow-ups

**If counselor is active and helpful:**
- What has your counselor recommended so far?
- Have they helped you build a college list?
- Note: This profile can complement and affirm the counselor's work

**If counselor is unavailable or unhelpful:**
- Is there another adult at school who helps with college planning? (Teacher, coach, college center)
- Are there community organizations that provide college guidance? (Community-based organizations, religious institutions, mentoring programs)
- Note: Flag this prominently in the report — student needs additional support resources

**If first-generation student:**
- Are you aware of programs specifically for first-gen students? (QuestBridge, fly-in programs, pre-college summer programs)
- Many colleges have first-gen student organizations and support offices
- Note: First-gen status is an important part of the student's story for applications

**If strong family involvement:**
- What are your parents' priorities for your college choice?
- Do your priorities align with theirs? (Important to surface early)
- Are there specific schools they want you to consider?

## Section 5: College Preferences (Emergent)

This section often emerges naturally from the conversation. Rather than asking
direct preference questions upfront, listen for signals throughout the interview
and confirm at the end.

### Synthesis Questions (ask toward end of interview)

- Based on what we've talked about, it sounds like [summary]. Does that feel right?
- Geography: How far from home are you willing to go?
- Size: Do you picture yourself at a big school or a small one? (Provide context: small = 1,000-3,000, medium = 3,000-10,000, large = 10,000+)
- Setting: City campus, college-town feel, or rural?
- Are there any deal-breakers? Things a school absolutely must or must not have?
- Is there a school you've already been thinking about? What draws you to it?

### Preference Signals to Track

Throughout the conversation, note implicit preferences:
- Student mentions loving their small high school → may prefer small college
- Student talks about wanting independence → may prefer distance from home
- Student emphasizes diversity → important campus characteristic
- Student mentions specific activities → check availability at potential schools
- Student expresses financial concern → schools with strong aid programs
